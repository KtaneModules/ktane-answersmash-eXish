                <h2>On the Subject of Answer Smash</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Earn yourself some Grunklebucks!</p>
                <p>Welcome everyone to Answer Smash! We’ve got an exciting show for you all here today! Please join me in welcoming today’s contestants, Defuser and Expert!</p>
                <p>Now let me explain how Answer Smash works for those who are new here. We’ve taken the names of 2 items from the hit website <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/">ktane.timwi.de</a>. The names have been smashed together, making the Answer Smash you see on the top screen. We follow a set of rules here when making our Answer Smashes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Both names must be at least 2 characters in length.</li>
                    <li>Both names are cut off at a character they share.</li>
                    <li>The items cannot be the same.</li>
                    <li>The items must have names with characters that can be typed on a US keyboard layout.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The goal of Answer Smash is for Defuser here to figure out the 2 items we picked to make our Answer Smash. However, if Defuser finds 2 different items that would make our Answer Smash, that’s A-OK! Of course if they can’t figure it out they can phone their friend Expert for help. Once Defuser has an answer, they will input both item names into the bottom displays using their keyboard and the yellow toggle button. If they are confident with their answer then they will press the green submit button. If they are correct, they win the major prize!</p>
                <p>Oh, I almost forgot! To up the ante we’ve strapped a bomb under Defuser’s chair! Huh? What the hell am I talking about? C’mon Defuser didn’t you read the fine print in our show’s contestant contract before signing it? Oh well, good luck and let’s begin!</p>
